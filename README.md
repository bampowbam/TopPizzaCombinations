# TopPizzaCombinations

Pizza Exercise
One of our restaurant clients wants to know which pizza topping combinations are the most popular.

Using a language in our technical stack, write an app or script that will download orders directly from http://files.olo.com/pizzas.json and output the top 20 most frequently ordered pizza topping combinations. List the toppings for each popular pizza topping combination along with its rank and the number of times that combination has been ordered.

This is just to practice algorithm and logic skills.

The csproj files has all the dependencies needed but I added them to this repo anyway in case you just wanted to download everything.
